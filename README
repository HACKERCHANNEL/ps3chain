This program will automatically build and install a compiler and other tools
used in the creation of homebrew software for the Sony Playstation 3.
Make sure you have autoconf, automake, bison, flex, makeinfo/texinfo, 
ncurses (dev package), gcc, make, and wget. You must then set $PS3DEV, and
add $PS3DEV/bin, $PS3DEV/ppu/bin, and $PS3DEV/spu/bin to your $PATH. Now
you are clear to execute ./buildit.sh all . For more information about PS3
homebrew, join #ps3dev on EFnet, and check out http://ps2dev.org/
